The device creates a simple PDF as a report. 

## Versions ##

It seems there are two versions with the same shell but different color (black and blue). The black uses a newer configuration tool written in .Net, which is not compatible with the old software. The black one also provides more settings:

* Calibration for humidity and temperature
* Control for timing start
* More alarm details

## Capture length ##
The internal memory holds 16384 values. So since each measurement consist on two values (temperature and humidity), with the following intervals, the length of the capture is:

| Interval  | Maximum captured period |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1s | 2.3h  |
| 2s | 4.6h  |
| 3s | 6.8h  |
| 4s | 9.1h  |
| 5s | 11.4h  |
| 6s | 13.7h  |
| 7s | 15.9h  |
| 8s | 18.2h  |
| 9s | 20.5h  |
| 10s | 22.8h  |
| 11s | 25h  |
| 12s | 27.3h  |
| 13s | 29.6h  |
| 14s | 31.9h  |
| 15s | 34.1h  |
| 20s | 45.5h  |
| 30s | 68.3h  |

Longer periods could be achieved in theory using an interval equal or greater than one minute:

| Interval  | Maximum captured period |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1m | 5.7d  |
| 2m | 11.4d  |
| 4m | 22.8d |
| 5m | 28.4d  |
| 5m27s | 31d  |
| 10m | 56.8d  |
| 1h4m10s | 365d  |
